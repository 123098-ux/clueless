### Project Description
Virtual Sandcastle Builder: Develop a game where players can build sandcastles on a virtual beach, but the sand is always washed away by virtual waves.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everything online lasts forever. But what if it didn‚Äôt?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Welcome to the Virtual Sandcastle Builder ‚Äì the digital sandbox where everything you create is doomed to disappear.

   We solved the nonexistent problem of digital permanence by creating an experience where:
   You build the most beautiful sandcastles your imagination can muster.
   You admire your masterpiece for a fleeting moment.
   And then... a wave comes in and destroys it. Every. Single. Time.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML,CSS,JS
- p5.js for artistic wave animations
- anime.js ‚Äì for smooth, dramatic wave destruction

## üì∏ Demo Screenshot

![Virtual Sandcastle Screenshot1](demo1.png)

This is the starting screen of your game.
No sand parts have been placed yet.
No waves or animations are happening at this point.
It‚Äôs waiting for the user to interact by clicking the button to start building.

![Virtual Sandcastle Screenshot2](demo2.png)
This screen shows the user actively placing sand parts on the canvas.
Each square represents a sand block added with every click on the ‚ÄúPlace Sand Part‚Äù button. 
The layout mimics a castle-building process, reflecting creativity in progress.

![Virtual Sandcastle Screenshot3](demo3.png)
This screen captures the dramatic moment when the wave begins sweeping across the canvas.
The sandcastle, built with care, is now being overtaken by the animated ocean wave.

 1. Game Introduction

    The browser displays a calming beach-themed page.
    The title reads "Virtual Sandcastle Builder Game" ‚Äî setting the playful tone.

 2. Building the Sandcastle

    The user clicks the "Place Sand Part üß±" button.
    Each click places a rectangular ‚Äúsand brick‚Äù onto the canvas, stacking parts in a fun little structure.
    A total of 6 sand parts can be placed ‚Äî forming a complete mini sandcastle.

 3. The Wave Approaches

    Once all parts are placed (or if time runs out after ~5 seconds), the game displays:
    The wave is coming!
    A blue animated wave slides across the canvas from left to right.
    A wave sound effect plays (via wave.mp3) for immersion.

4. The Castle Gets Destroyed

    As the wave rolls in, it wipes out all the sand parts (symbolically destroying the sandcastle).
    A message appears:
    "Your castle was destroyed! Try again."

5. Game Resets Automatically

    After a short pause, the canvas resets and the game auto-restarts.
    Players can try again and again, but‚Ä¶ the wave always returns
   
    What's Being Demonstrated
    User Interaction: Click-based gameplay to build a sandcastle.
    Game Logic: Automatic wave trigger on timeout or completion.
    Visuals: Canvas animations and simulated wave movement.
    Sound Design: Wave audio synced with animation.
    Replayability: Game resets after destruction, inviting endless cycles.
